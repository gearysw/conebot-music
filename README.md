# Conebot Music

With Rythm shutting down its music streaming service, I decided to code my own music streaming bot for the VMS team.

## Deploying
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Make a `config.json` file that follows the example template using your own values
3. Deploy slash commands by running `node deploy.js`
4. Start the bot by running `node bot.js`
